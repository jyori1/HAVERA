                 <h2> IMPROVE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND MOOD </h2>
                 Physical activity releases chemicals like endorphins and serotonin that improve your mood. You're basically getting happier by exercising!
                 Exercise even pumps more blood to the brain, increases the size of the hippocampus (responsible for memory in the brain), and increases connections between nerve cells; hence, better memory and thinking.
                </div>

              <div class="slide2">
                 <h2>HEALTHIER SKIN AND COMPLEXION</h2>
                 Due to how exercise pumps more blood, this increased blood flow allows for nutrients and oxygen to travel throughout the body--most notably, the skin.
                 The blood flow evidently aids in carrying away waste products, hence cleansing your skin from the inside as well.
                </div>

              <div class="slide3">
                 <h2>REDUCE YOUR HEART DISEASE RISK</h2>
                 We cannot stress this enough, the more blood pumped with each beat allows for it to beat slower and keep your blood pressure under control!
                 This applies within the small blood vessels around your heart, the arteries, clogs within these vessels are the root cause of heart attacks.
                 Exercise even increases your levels of HDL cholesterol (GOOD), it's responsible for flushing the artery-clogging LDL cholesterol (BAD).
                 With this your heart disease risk is significantly lowered.
               </div>

             <div class="slide4">
                 <h2>WEIGHT LOSS</h2>
                 Studies show that exercise helps in weight loss, even just one hour of exercise can help you maintain your weight loss rate.
                 Physical activity changes your body's composition, decreasing your body mass as well as your fat mass!
                 Your resting metabolism rate is also improved; thus, you can eventually digest a lot of food and burn it off much faster than before!
                 You'll also gear towards healthier food preferences over time. By becoming more fit, we're also making our body image more positive, hence
                 a happier lifestyle! A win-win situation!
               </div>

            <div class="slide5">
                 <h2>BETTER SLEEP</h2>
                 Evidence indicates that exercise can be an effective natural therapy for people with insomnia, as well as other sleeping disorders.
                 It triggers and increase in body temperature post-exercise--which promotes sleeping.
